# KPDL - Bean Leaf Lesions Classification

This repository contains the Bean Leaf Lesions Classification dataset from Kaggle for machine learning research and development.

## Dataset Information

**Source:** [Bean Leaf Lesions Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/bean-leaf-lesions-classification)

This dataset contains images of bean leaves with various types of lesions, useful for developing machine learning models for plant disease classification.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Kaggle API Credentials

To download the dataset, you need to set up Kaggle API credentials:

1. Go to [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account)
2. Scroll to the **API** section
3. Click **"Create New API Token"** to download `kaggle.json`
4. Move the file to the appropriate location:
   - **Linux/Mac:** `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<Username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json`
5. Set proper permissions (Linux/Mac only):
   ```bash
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Run the download script:

```bash
python download_dataset.py
```

The dataset will be downloaded and extracted to the `data/` directory.

## Alternative: Manual Download

If you prefer to download the dataset manually:

1. Visit the [dataset page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/bean-leaf-lesions-classification)
2. Click the **Download** button
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file into the `data/` directory
